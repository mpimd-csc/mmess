function Y = mess_LDL_mul_D(eqn,D,X)
%
%  Computes Y = D * X
%
% Here D is the center matrix in the LDL' representation. It can be given
% either as the full D matrix such that D * X can be computed directly, or
% implicitly stored, e.g., as a vector D such that the actual D matrix is
% kron(diag(D), eqn.S). The later is done, e.g, in the LDL' formulation of
% the low-rank ADI, while in differential Riccati solvers we typically have
% a small D matrix such that the actual D is kron(D,eqn.S)
%
% In the latter cases we exploit
%
%   kron(F,eqn.S)*vec(Z) = vec(eqn.S * Z * F')
%
% where F is either diag(D) or D, which can be efficiently expressed using
% reshape.
