function [rw, Hp, Hm, Vp, Vm] = get_ritz_vals_dae_2(eqn, opts, oper, U, W, p_old)
%  This function is an exact copy of the Penzl heuristic part in mess_para.
%  the only difference is that B or C and K are filled up by trailing zero
%  blocks to allow for the computation of the Ritz values with respect to
%  the full size block matrices instead of the restriction to the
%  (1,1)-block for which the ADI is formulated.
