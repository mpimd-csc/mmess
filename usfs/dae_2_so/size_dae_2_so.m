function n = size_dae_2_so(eqn, opts, oper)%#ok<INUSD>
% function n = size_dae_2_so(eqn, opts, oper)
%
% This function returns the number of rows of the implicitly projected A 
% matrix of the index-2 system.
%
%   Input:
%
%   eqn     struct contains data for equations
%
%   opts    struct contains parameters for the algorithm
%
%   oper    struct contains function handles for operation 
%           with A and E
%
%   Output:
%
%   n       size of the implicitly projected A matrix
