    "M-M.E.S.S.   provides low-rank solvers for large-scale symmetric matrix equations
           with sparse or sparse + low rank coefficients. The main focus is on
           differential and algebraic Riccati equations appearing in control and model
           order reduction, as well as algebraic Lyapunov equations for, e.g., balanced
           truncation.
    
           The  underlying  dynamical  system may be of first or second order and 
           structured proper differential algebraic equations (DAEs) that allow for
           implicit index reduction are also supported.
    
           The  solvers philosophy is to always work on the implicitly linearized (for
           second order systems) and/or implicitly projected (in the DAE case) matrix
           equations. That means the implicit Lyapunov or Riccati equation is always of
           the form known for a standard first order ODE, that may have a non identity
           but invertible E matrix.
    
           Further, M-M.E.S.S. provides functions for Balanced Truncation and
           (tangential) iterative rational Krylov algorithm (IRKA) for model order 
           reduction (MOR) of first order state space systems and some examples
           demonstrate the use of the algorithms in MOR of second order systems and DAEs.
    
           In close relation to the predecessor LyaPack, we use user supplied functions
           (usfs) that implement the actions of the system matrices E and A in 
           multiplication  and  (shifted) solves. We provide those functions for
           standard state space systems, second order systems, structured DAEs of
           index 1 and 2, as well as second order DAEs of index 1, 2 and 3. For more
           information on usfs see help mess_usfs."
