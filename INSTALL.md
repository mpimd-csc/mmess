Install Instructions  						{#install}
====================

## Dependencies

Generally, the Software should run fine in plain MATLAB and
OCTAVE. However, for optimal performance of the projection based
approaches it can be advantageous to have the corresponding control
systems toolbox providing optimized solvers for dense Lyapunov and
Riccati equations.


## Installing M.E.S.S.

### ZIP-archive based downloads
Simply unpack the content of the archive to some folder, change to
that folder before you use it and run 'mess_path'. This will add this
folder together with all subfolders to your MATLAB/Octave search
path. If you do not want to do this every time you need to work with
M.E.S.S., simply add all the above folders to the default search path.
