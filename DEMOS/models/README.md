This directory contains the collection of benchmark examples used in
the demonstration examples.

**Data_Rail**
  The well known Rail example from the Oberwolfach Collection.

**FDM_2D**
  Contains the functions for generating scalable models of the finite
  difference semi-discretized model of a heat equation on th unit
  square. The functios support convection , as well as reaction
  terms. They are exact copies of the files from the Lyapack package.

**NSE**
  Prepared to store the external download for the Karman vortex
  shedding model in a 2d channel. See The README file in the folder
  for more instructions.

**SingleChainMSD**
  A simple scalable mass spring damper system

**TripleCchain**
  The Truhar/Veselic model made from three coupled mass-spring-damper
  chains.

**msd_ind3_by_t_stykel**
  Tatjana Stykels mass spring damper system with holonomic
  constraints. i.e., the index-3 DAE case.

**stokes**
  The finite volume semidiscretized Stokes (index-2) model by Tatjana
  Stykel and Michael Schmidt.


The M.E.S.S. team would like to thank Tatjana Stykel for providing the
routines for the index-3 MSD model and the stokes model. 

The mmread and mmwrite functions are redistributed under the terms
